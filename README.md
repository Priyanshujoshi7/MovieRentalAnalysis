# MovieRentalAnalysis

ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to design and develop an interactive Power BI dashboard using the Sakila DVD Rental Store Database. The dashboard aims to deliver meaningful insights into key aspects of the rental business, including customer behavior, film inventory management, staff performance, and overall store operations.

By consolidating data into a unified, visually engaging report, the dashboard will empower stakeholders to make data-driven decisions that improve business performance. The analysis will focus on:

Customer Segmentation â€“ understanding new vs. repeat customers, preferences, and demographics.

Sales Trends â€“ analyzing revenue patterns, seasonal demand, and payment history.

Film Performance â€“ identifying top-performing categories and underperforming titles.

Staff Productivity â€“ measuring employee efficiency and its impact on customer satisfaction.

Store Revenue Analysis â€“ comparing performance across multiple locations.

The ultimate goal is to optimize film inventory, enhance customer satisfaction, improve staff efficiency, and streamline operations. Actionable recommendations will include targeted marketing campaigns, film collection enhancements, and staff training initiatives.
